<h1>Week 13 - Class 1 - Homework - APIs</h1>

<h2>Deliverable: An API using Express.</h2>
<p>Development: You should reproduce what was done by the teacher Hope in class. You can go further and add more
coding, as long as it runs ok at the localhost and assigned port.
</p>
1. Create a folder for your API Homework
2. Navigate to this folder from the Terminal -> use cd folderName to enter into the created folder
3. Then type code . to open your VSCode in the correct place
4. Create a server.js file
5. Include in it the code to listen to the port 3000
6. Open the Terminal inside the VSCode and type npm init -y , to create a package.json file
7. Still in the terminal, type npm install express --save , to install express
8. Complete your code including a GET (Read) request method, and rout it to localhost:3000/homework
9. To run your API, type npm run start
10. Upload your code into a new repository at your GitHub, and share the repo link when you hand your homework in.
11. If when we call localhost:3000/homework or localhost:3000/homework/id some message or data is displayed,
with no error message, you will score 100 =)
